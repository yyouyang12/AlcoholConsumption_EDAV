# Introduction

With the growing pressures in modern life and sharp changes in lifestyle nowadays, many people turn to alcohol to relieve their physical and mental stress. While sometimes alcohol may offer a temporary escape from the stressful world, it can lead to bigger problems like worsening our health conditions, especially for those with chronic or mental health conditions. This phenomenon raises important questions about the relationship between these health conditions and alcohol consumption. On the one hand, patients should stay away from alcohol to manage their health conditions more effectively; on the other hand, people suffering from long-term illnesses may want to escape the pain for a while by using methods such as ingesting alcohol. So, the direction of the relationship between health conditions and alcohol consumption remains an open-ended question. We want to know whether people with chronic or mental health problems will have different drinking patterns from others and whether there are specific patterns that increase alcohol consumption among various populations. By exploring this, we hope to find practical ways to support people dealing with both health issues and alcohol use.
