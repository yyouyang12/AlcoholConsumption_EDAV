# The Relationship Between Health Conditions and Alcohol Consumption

## Overview

This project explores the intricate patterns and relationship between health conditions and alcohol consumption. With the growing pressures of modern life, many individuals turn to alcohol as a means of coping with physical and emotional stress. While this provide short-term relief, it can exacerbate health problems over time, leading to a vicious cycle.

By analyzing data and identifying patterns, this project aims to answer key questions: - Do people with chronic or mental health conditions exhibit different drinking behaviors compared to others? - Are there specific health conditions linked to higher alcohol consumption?

The goal is to provide actionable insights and strategies for supporting individuals dealing with both health issues and alcohol use, paving the way for better health interventions.
