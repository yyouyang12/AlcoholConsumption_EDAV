# Conclusion

Our project provides several important insights into the relationship between alcohol consumption and health conditions. While individuals with Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) are generally more likely to engage in heavy drinking compared to those without the disorder, our findings challenge the common assumption that AUD is equivalent to excessive alcohol consumption. In fact, about 60% of individuals with AUD drink alcohol in low to moderate amounts, suggesting that AUD should not be defined solely by the quantity of alcohol consumed. Additionally, we observed a strong link between mental health disorders (depression, anxiety, and PTSD) and high alcohol consumption, which indicates that alcohol may often serve as a coping mechanism for mental health struggles. This highlights the need for holistic approaches that address both mental health and drinking behaviors, because alcohol use may not only exacerbate mental health challenges, but also lead to a malicious cycle.
