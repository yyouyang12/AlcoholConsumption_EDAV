# Conclusion

We explored the relationship between various health conditions and alcohol consumption patterns. One of the key findings is that Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) does not always imply heavy drinking. While AUD is commonly associated with heavy alcohol consumption, we found that over 60% of individuals with AUD consume relatively low or moderate amounts of alcohol. This challenges conventional assumptions and suggests that AUD should not be defined solely by the quantity of alcohol consumed.

Another critical finding is the strong link between mental health conditions and high alcohol consumption. People with mental health disorders such as depression, anxiety, and PTSD are more likely to consume alcohol in larger quantities. Alcohol may serve as a potential coping mechanism for mental health struggles, suggesting that addressing mental health issues could be key to reducing drinking behaviors. Additionally, the relationship between mental health and alcohol consumption may also indicate the effect of alcohol on mental health, further emphasizing the need for more comprehensive treatment and prevention approaches that address both mental health and alcohol use.

Furthermore, individuals with Alcohol Use Disorder are more likely to engage in heavy drinking. Although over 60% of those with AUD consume relatively low or moderate amounts of alcohol, there is a clear trend that those with AUD tend to drink more compared to those without the disorder. This finding highlights the importance of targeted interventions for individuals with AUD, as they are at a higher risk for severe alcohol-related problems.

Despite these valuable findings, our study has some limitations. First, all data is self-reported, which may introduce bias and may not accurately reflect actual behavior. This could potentially invalidate the relationship between variables. Secondly, our study only identifies correlations, which does not imply causality. Future research could use longitudinal data to examine how changes in mental health or AUD may influence alcohol consumption over time.
