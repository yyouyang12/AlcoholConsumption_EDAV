    "section": "",
    "text": "1 Introduction\nWith the growing pressures in modern life and sharp changes in lifestyle nowadays, many people turn to alcohol to relieve their physical and mental stress. While sometimes alcohol may offer a temporary escape from the stressful world, it can lead to bigger problems like worsening our health conditions, especially for those with chronic or mental health conditions. This phenomenon raises important questions about the relationship between these health conditions and alcohol consumption. On the one hand, patients should stay away from alcohol to manage their health conditions more effectively; on the other hand, people suffering from long-term illnesses may want to escape the pain for a while by using methods such as ingesting alcohol. So, the direction of the relationship between health conditions and alcohol consumption remains an open-ended question. We want to know whether people with chronic or mental health problems will have different drinking patterns from others and whether there are specific patterns that increase alcohol consumption among various populations. By exploring this, we hope to find practical ways to support people dealing with both health issues and alcohol use.",

    "text": "2.1 Description\nThe dataset used in this project originates from the Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR), specifically study 39192. Collected via survey in 2023, the data aims to investigate various factors related to well-being and health. The source data is provided in multiple formats; for this project, we used the .RData format, which was loaded into R for analysis. We also converted it into a .csv file as a backup for easier inspection and sharing.\nThe complete dataset comprises 7,105 rows and 348 columns. For this study, we focus on a sliced version of the data, selecting 14 columns in total: 2 columns related to alcohol consumption and 12 columns related to health conditions, particularly chronic and mental health conditions. The accompanying data codebook provides detailed documentation on the dataset’s background, structure, and variable definitions. Upon inspection using the codebook, no significant data quality issues were identified.\nWe conducted exploratory analysis in R, leveraging its robust data manipulation and visualization capabilities. The dataset is publicly available through the ICPSR website, and additional documentation can be accessed at the provided link.",

    "text": "2.2 Missing value analysis\nThe dataset’s codebook specifies clear notations for missing values. Each entry follows the format (n) &lt;value&gt;, where (n) is the coded version of the information and &lt;value&gt; is the survey response. Missing data are represented by either \"(98) Don't know\" or \"(99) Refusal\", while valid responses are coded with smaller integers. This explicit notation simplifies the handling of missing data during preprocessing. To ensure the integrity of our analysis, we removed all rows containing any missing values. After processing, the dataset was reduced to approximately 5,600 rows.\nVisualizations are included below to illustrate the distribution and patterns of missing values before cleaning. From the cumulative missing values plot, we observe a gradual and consistent accumulation of missing data across rows, without sudden spikes or concentrations. This indicates that missingness is evenly distributed throughout the dataset and not concentrated in specific subsets of observations.\n\n\nCode\n# Count cumulative missing values for each row\nrow_missing &lt;- data_with_na %&gt;%\n  mutate(MissingCount = rowSums(is.na(.))) %&gt;%\n  mutate(CumulativeMissing = cumsum(MissingCount))  # Calculate cumulative sum\n\n# Plot cumulative missing values across rows\nggplot(row_missing, aes(x = seq_along(CumulativeMissing), y = CumulativeMissing)) +\n  geom_line(color = \"steelblue\") +\n  labs(title = \"Cumulative Missing Data Across Rows\",\n       x = \"Row Index\",\n       y = \"Cumulative Missing Values\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe bar chart provides a variable-level overview of missingness. It highlights that certain variables, such as HIGH_BP, HIGH_CHOL, and PTSD, have the highest numbers of missing entries, each exceeding 300. In contrast, variables such as ALCOHOL and ALC_NUM exhibit minimal missingness, with fewer than 5 missing entries each. This suggests that missing data is more prevalent in health-related variables, possibly because respondents were less willing or able to provide detailed health information.\n\n\nCode\n# Replace (98) and (99) with NA in the dataset\n# data_with_na &lt;- data %&gt;%\n#   mutate(across(everything(), ~ ifelse(grepl(\"\\\\(98\\\\)|\\\\(99\\\\)\", .), NA, .)))\n\n# Heatmap of missing data\ngg_miss_var(data_with_na) +\n  labs(title = \"Bar Chart of Missing Data\", y = \"Number of Missing Values\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# Count missing values per column\nmissing_summary &lt;- data_with_na %&gt;%\n  summarise(across(everything(), ~ sum(is.na(.)))) %&gt;%\n  pivot_longer(everything(), names_to = \"Variable\", values_to = \"MissingCount\")",

    "text": "3.3 Distribution of Independent Variables\n\n3.3.1 Overall Independent Variables Distribution by Diverging Bar Chart\nWe first dive into the independent factors, namely the twelve health condition variables selected in our data set. We categorized all of them into three groups based on their characteristics. This grouping provides a logical framework for the subsequent analysis, and the categories are consistently referenced throughout the study. By organizing data this way, we aim to clearly present the characteristics of each variable and their potential influence on alcohol use. The three groups are given as follows:\n\nChronic Diseases: Includes Overweight, High Cholesterol, High Blood Pressure, Heart Disease, Diabetes, COPD, and Auto-immune disease.\nMental Health Conditions: Includes PTSD, Depression, and Anxiety.\nSubstance Use Disorders: Includes Alcohol Use Disorder and Drug Use Disorder.\n\n\n\nCode\n# Prepare data with groups and filter unused conditions\ndata_grouped &lt;- data |&gt;\n  pivot_longer(cols = everything(), names_to = \"Condition\", values_to = \"Response\") |&gt;\n  mutate(Group = case_when(\n    Condition %in% c(\"HIGH_BP\", \"HIGH_CHOL\", \"DIABETES\", \"HEART\", \"OVERWEIGHT\", \"COPD\", \"IMMUNE\") ~ \"Chronic Diseases\",\n    Condition %in% c(\"DEPRESSION\", \"ANXIETY\", \"PTSD\") ~ \"Mental Health Conditions\",\n    Condition %in% c(\"ALC_DIS\", \"DRUG_DIS\") ~ \"Substance Use Disorders\"\n  )) |&gt;\n  filter(!is.na(Group))  |&gt;\n  mutate(Condition = label_mapping[Condition])\n\n\n# Prepare summary data for diverging bar chart\ndata_summary &lt;- data_grouped |&gt;\n  count(Group, Condition, Response) |&gt;\n  group_by(Group, Condition) |&gt;\n  mutate(Percentage = n / sum(n) * 100,\n         Side = ifelse(Response == \"Yes\", Percentage, -Percentage))\n\n# Plot with facet_grid for more flexible layout\nggplot(data_summary, aes(x = Condition, y = Side, fill = Response)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", width = 0.7) +\n  coord_flip() +\n  facet_grid(rows = vars(Group), scales = \"free_y\", space = \"free\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = abs) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Health Conditions by Group\",\n    x = \"Condition\",\n    y = \"Percentage\",\n    fill = \"Response\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1),\n    strip.text.y = element_text(angle = 0, hjust = 1), # Tilt group names horizontally\n    strip.text = element_text(face = \"bold\"),\n    legend.position = \"bottom\"\n  ) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"No\" = \"#E69F00\", \"Yes\" = \"#56B4E9\"))\n\n\n\n\n\nFig1: Diverging stacked bar chart\n\n\n\n\nWe now observe the distributions of each variable. Figure 1 shows a bar chart that compares how many people in each category of health conditions responded “Yes” (they have the condition) or “No” (they do not have the condition). The bars pointing to the right represent those who answered “Yes,” while the bars pointing to the left represent those who answered “No.” We can see that many people report mental health diseases, with almost half of the respondents answering “Yes” to Anxiety. In addition, they are not many people reporting substance use, either drug or alcohol.\n\n\n3.3.2 Mental Health Conditions Often Occur Together\nWe can also examine the co-occurrence of different health challenges. The following heatmap shows how often different diseases occur together. The darker the color, the more likely two diseases are to appear in the same individuals. A key takeaway from this graph is that mental health conditions — like anxiety, depression, and PTSD — tend to appear together more often. However, for other diseases, such co-occurrence is relatively weak. Additionally, these mental conditions seems appear alongside substance use disorders (e.g., alcohol and drug abuse), forming a distinct group.\n\n\nCode\n# Convert Yes/No responses to numeric (Yes = 1, No = 0)\ndata_numeric &lt;- data |&gt;\n  mutate(across(everything(), ~ ifelse(. == \"Yes\", 1, 0)))\n\n# Calculate correlations between health conditions\ncor_matrix &lt;- data_numeric |&gt;\n  select(names(label_mapping)) |&gt;\n  cor()\n\n# Apply the mapping for better labels\ncolnames(cor_matrix) &lt;- rownames(cor_matrix) &lt;- label_mapping[colnames(cor_matrix)]\n\n# Convert correlation matrix to long format for ggplot\ncor_melted &lt;- melt(cor_matrix)\n\n# Plot the heatmap\nplot2 &lt;- ggplot(cor_melted, aes(x = Var1, y = Var2, fill = value)) +\n  geom_tile(color = \"white\") +\n  scale_fill_gradient2(low = \"#3182BD\", mid = \"white\", high = \"#EC6B80\", midpoint = 0,\n                       name = \"Correlation\") +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Co-Occurrence of Health Conditions\",\n    x = \"Condition\",\n    y = \"Condition\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1),\n    axis.title = element_text(face = \"bold\"),\n    panel.grid.major = element_blank(),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n  )\nplot2\n\n\n\n\n\nFig2: Co-occurrence of Mental Health Conditions",

Therefore, we combined these individuals with those who answered “Did not consume any alcohol in the past 30 days” to form the “no drink” group.\n\n\nCode\ntable_data_1 &lt;- data.frame(\n  Original_Answer = names(alcohol_mapping),\n  Abbreviation_Answer = alcohol_short_labels[as.character(alcohol_mapping)]\n)\n\ntable_data_2 &lt;- data.frame(\n  Original_Answer = names(alc_num_mapping),\n  Abbreviation_Answer = alc_num_short_labels[as.character(alc_num_mapping)]\n)\n\nkable(table_data_1, caption = \"Alcohol Consumption Frequency\", align = \"c\", col.names = c(\"Original Answer\", \"Abbreviation Answer\")) %&gt;%\n  kable_styling(full_width = F, position = \"left\") %&gt;%\n  footnote(general = \"When it comes to alcohol, which of the following best describe you?\",\n           general_title = \"Survey question:\",\n           footnote_as_chunk = TRUE)\n\n\n\nAlcohol Consumption Frequency\n\n\nOriginal Answer\nAbbreviation Answer\n\n\n\n\nI have never drunk alcohol or have only tried it once or twice.\nNever/Once\n\n\nI used to drink but no longer drink alcohol.\nUsed to drink\n\n\nI typically drink alcohol less often than once a month.\n&lt; Monthly\n\n\nI typically drink alcohol more than once a month but not weekly.\n&gt; Monthly\n\n\nI typically drink alcohol 1-2 days per week.\n1-2 days/week\n\n\nI typically drink alcohol 3-5 days per week.\n3-5 days/week\n\n\nI typically drink alcohol 6-7 days per week.\n6-7 days/week\n\n\n\nSurvey question:  When it comes to alcohol, which of the following best describe you?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nkable(table_data_2, caption = \"Alcohol Consumption Quantity\", align = \"c\", col.names = c(\"Original Answer\", \"Abbreviation Answer\")) %&gt;%\n  kable_styling(full_width = F, position = \"left\") %&gt;%\n  footnote(general = \"During the past month, how many alcoholic beverages (such as beer, wine, malt beverage, liquor) did you consume per week on average?

As the frequency of consumption increases beyond once a month, the number of people decreases. The smallest proportion of the population, less than 5%, drinks very frequently, at about 6-7 days per week.\nIn terms of alcohol consumption quantity, the proportion of people decreases as the amount of alcohol consumed increases. More than 50% of respondents report consuming no alcohol at all.\n\n\n3.4.3 Correlation Between Frequency and Quantity\nThen, we examine the relationship between alcohol consumption frequency (on the x-axis) and alcohol consumption quantity (indicated by the fill color).\n\n\nCode\nplot4 &lt;- ggplot(data, aes(x = factor(ALCOHOL_FREQ),fill = factor(ALC_NUM_FREQ))) + \n  geom_bar(color = \"black\", stat = \"count\") + \n  labs(title = \"Alcohol Consumptionn\", \n       x = \"Alcohol Consumption Frequency\", \n       y = \"Count\", \n       fill = \"Alcohol Consumption Quantity\") + \n  theme_minimal() + \n  scale_x_discrete(labels = alcohol_short_labels) +\n  scale_fill_manual(\n    values = RColorBrewer::brewer.pal(7, \"Blues\"),\n    labels = alc_num_short_labels) +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))\n\nplot4\n\n\n\n\n\nFig4: Alcohol Consumption Frequency Distribution Filled by Quantity\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# cor(data$ALCOHOL_FREQ, data$ALC_NUM_FREQ)\n\n\nWe can find that as the alcohol consumption frequency increases, the proportion of people who consume a higher quantity of alcohol also rises. People who drink more frequently tend to report higher alcohol consumption quantities. This trend is confirmed by the strong positive correlation between alcohol consumption frequency and alcohol consumption quantity (r = 0.86). Given the high correlation and the fact that quantity is more suitable for quantitative analysis as it is quantitatively clarified, we will only focus on the quantity variable to simplify analysis.\n\n\n3.4.4 Categorizing Alcohol Quantity\nWe group the quantity variable into categories. The three groups are given as follows:\n\nLow: Includes “Question was not asked,” “Did not consume any alcohol in the past 30 days,” and “Average of 1 or fewer drinks per week”. These answers represent very low or no alcohol consumption\nModerate: Includes “Average of 2-4 drinks per week” and “Average of 5-7 drinks per week”. These people report a reasonable level of drinking.\nHigh: Includes “Average of 8-15 drinks per week” and “Average of more than 15 drinks per week”.

Individuals with any of these conditions are coded as “Yes,” while those with none are coded as “No.” The bar chart below illustrates the relationship between this combined feature and alcohol consumption. Notably, among “High frequency” drinkers—defined as those consuming 8 or more drinks per week—more than half report having at least one of these conditions.\n\n\nCode\n# Assuming the data frame is named 'data'\n# Create a new feature combining the three conditions\ndata_cleaned_aggr$Combined_Condition &lt;- ifelse(\n  data_cleaned_aggr$HIGH_BP == \"Yes\" | \n  data_cleaned_aggr$DRUG_DIS == \"Yes\" | \n  data_cleaned_aggr$ALC_DIS == \"Yes\", \n  \"Yes\", \n  \"No\"\n)\n\n# Check the distribution of the new feature\n# table(data_cleaned_aggr$Combined_Condition)\n\n# Analyze the relationship with alcohol consumption\n# Assuming 'ALC_NUM_CATE' represents alcohol consumption categories\n\n\nplot9 &lt;- ggplot(data_cleaned_aggr, aes(x = ALC_NUM_CATE, fill = Combined_Condition)) +\n  geom_bar(position = \"fill\", width = 0.6) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Relationship Between Combined Condition and Alcohol Consumption\",\n    x = \"Alcohol Consumption Quantity Category\",\n    y = \"Proportion\",\n    fill = \"Combined Condition\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(panel.grid.minor = element_blank()) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"No\" = \"#E69F00\", \"Yes\" = \"#56B4E9\"))\nplot9\n\n\n\n\n\nFig9: Relationship Between Combined Condition and Alcohol Consumption\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.5.2 Mental Health Conditions Linked With High Alcohol Consumption\nBase on the finding in figure 2: the three typical mental health disorders and two types of addictions form groups with significant pairwise correlations in the heatmap, and given that these five conditions are commonly understood to be interconnected, we created this alluvial diagram to visualize the relationships between these variables and the outcome variable.\n\n\nCode\nplot10 &lt;- ggplot(data,aes(axis1 = DEPRESSION, axis2 = ANXIETY, axis3 = PTSD, axis4 = ALC_DIS, axis5 = DRUG_DIS, axis6 = ALC_NUM_CATE_TEXT )) +\n  geom_alluvium(aes(fill = ALC_NUM_CATE_TEXT), width = 0.3) + \n  geom_stratum() + \n  geom_text(stat = \"stratum\", \n            aes(label = paste(after_stat(stratum), \"\\n\", after_stat(count))), \n            size = 2.5, \n            check_overlap = TRUE) +\n  labs(title = \"Alluvial Diagram of Mental Health, Substance Use Disorders, and Alcohol Consumption\",\n       x = NULL,\n       y = \"Number of Individuals\") +\n  scale_x_discrete(limits = c(\"Depression\", \"Anxiety\", \"PTSD\", \"Alcohol Use Disorder\", \"Drug Use Disorder\",\"Alcohol Consumption Quantity\")) +\n  # scale_x_discrete(labels = abel_mapping) +\n  scale_fill_viridis_d(option = \"D\", name = \"Alcohol Consumption Quantity Category\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))\nplot10\n\n\n\n\n\nFig10: The Relationship Between Mental Health, Substance Use Disorders, and Alcohol Consumption\n\n\n\n\nWe observe that individuals without mental health or substance use disorders generally have low alcohol consumption. Conversely, people with substance use disorders and some mental health conditions (e.g., PTSD) transition to higher alcohol consumption frequencies (moderate or high), suggesting alcohol consumption may be associated with these conditions. For high alcohol consumption, relatively high people experiencing AUD. For those in the moderate alcohol consumption, there are some people experience depression, anxiety and PTSD simultaneously. This may suggest that moderate alcohol consumption is more associated with mental health struggles.\nAs hypothesized, people with mental health issues (e.g., anxiety, depression) might use alcohol as a coping mechanism, increasing the likelihood of medium or high alcohol consumption.\n\n\nCode\n# contingency_table &lt;- table(data$ALC_DIS, data$ALC_NUM_FREQ)\n# chisq.test(contingency_table)\n\n\n\n\n3.5.3 Alcohol Use Disorder Does Not Always Imply Heavy Drinking\nFrom Figure 10, we observe that individuals with Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) are distributed across all levels of alcohol consumption, not just concentrated in the high-consumption group. Some of you might question our inclusion of AUD in the feature, as we often assume that having AUD implies drinking abusively. However, this is not necessarily the case.\n\n\nCode\n# Filter data for individuals with Alcohol Use Disorder\naud_people &lt;- data_cleaned_aggr[data_cleaned_aggr$ALC_DIS == \"Yes\", ]\n\n# Calculate the distribution of alcohol consumption categories among AUD people\naud_consumption &lt;- table(aud_people$ALC_NUM_CATE)\n\n# Convert to a data frame for plotting\naud_consumption_df &lt;- as.data.frame(aud_consumption)\ncolnames(aud_consumption_df) &lt;- c(\"Alcohol_Consumption\", \"Count\")\n\n# Calculate percentages for the pie chart\naud_consumption_df$Percentage &lt;- (aud_consumption_df$Count / sum(aud_consumption_df$Count)) * 100\n\n\n\nplot11 &lt;- ggplot(aud_consumption_df, aes(x = \"\", y = Count, fill = Alcohol_Consumption)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", width = 1) +\n  coord_polar(\"y\") +\n  geom_text(\n    aes(label = paste0(round(Percentage, 1), \"%\")), \n    position = position_stack(vjust = 0.5), \n    size = 3\n  ) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Alcohol Consumption Categories Among AUD Individuals\",\n    fill = \"Alcohol Consumption Quantity Category\"\n  ) +\n  scale_fill_manual(\n    values = c(\"Low\" = \"#EC6B80\", \"Moderate\" = \"#FFC154\", \"High\" = \"#47B39C\") # Custom colors\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    axis.title.x = element_blank(),\n    axis.title.y = element_blank(),\n    axis.text = element_blank(),\n    panel.grid = element_blank()\n  )\nplot11\n\n\n\n\n\nFig11: Alcohol Consumption Categories Among AUD Individuals\n\n\n\n\nThe pie chart below shows the distribution of alcohol consumption categories—Low, Moderate, and High—among individuals with AUD. Notably, a significant portion of those with AUD fall into the “Low” (36.2%) and “Moderate” (22.5%) categories, which means that about 60% AUD individuals drink less than 8 drinks per week. These finding challenges conventional perceptions and highlights the diverse drinking patterns among those with AUD, also justifying our feature. We see this discrepancy because AUD is not solely about how much alcohol someone consume, but also considers patterns of drinking, loss of control, and the impact on daily life. For instance, someone with AUD may drink moderately but struggles difficult to stop, or someone may actively try to cut down alcohol use after diagnosing AUD.\nTo explore this further, we analyzed the relationship between AUD and Alcohol consumption frequency using the more accurate categorization (the original 6 levels one) frequency.\n\n\nCode\ndata_percent &lt;- data |&gt;\n  group_by(ALC_NUM_FREQ) |&gt;\n  count(ALC_DIS) |&gt;\n  mutate(percent = n / sum(n) * 100)\n\ndata_percent_disorder &lt;- data |&gt;\n  group_by(ALC_DIS) |&gt;\n  count(ALC_NUM_FREQ) |&gt;\n  mutate(percent = n / sum(n) * 100)\n\nplot12a &lt;- ggplot(data_percent_disorder, aes(x = factor(ALC_DIS), y = percent, fill = factor(ALC_NUM_FREQ))) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\",color = \"black\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Alcohol Use Disorder\",\n    y = \"Percentage\",\n    fill = \"Alcohol Quantity\") +\n  scale_fill_manual(\n    values = RColorBrewer::brewer.pal(6, \"Blues\"),\n    labels = alc_num_short_labels\n  ) + \n  scale_x_discrete(labels = c(\"No\", \"Yes\")) +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format(scale = 1)) +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 0, hjust = 0.5))\n\nplot12b &lt;- ggplot(data_percent, aes(x = factor(ALC_NUM_FREQ), y = percent, fill = ALC_DIS)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Alcohol Consumption Quantity Category\",\n    y = \"Percentage\",\n    fill = \"Alcohol Disorder\") +\n  # scale_fill_manual(\n  #   values = RColorBrewer::brewer.pal(7, \"BrBG\")[c(2, 6)]) + \n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"No\" = \"#E69F00\", \"Yes\" = \"#56B4E9\")) +\n  scale_x_discrete(labels = alc_num_short_labels) +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format(scale = 1))+\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))\n\n\n# 左右拼接图\nplot12 &lt;- grid.arrange(plot12a, plot12b, ncol = 2,heights = c(5, 1), top = \"Relationship Between Alcohol Consumption and Alcohol Use Disorder\")\n\n\n\n\n\nFig12: Relationship Between Alcohol Consumption and Alcohol Use Disorder\n\n\n\n\nCode\ninvisible(plot12)\n\n\nFrom the left plot of Figure 12, as we observed before in figure 11, the proportion of individuals who drink less than 8 per week is the majority of AUD population. And those do not drink alcohol is the largest in the disorder group.\n\n\n3.5.4 People With Alcohol Use Disorder More Likely To Engage In Heavy Drinking\nFrom the left plot of Figure 12, we can also observe that people with AUD has a higher proportion of individuals who consume alcohol at higher frequencies (8-15 drinks per week and more than 15 drinks per week) than those without disorder. The disorder group shows more severe alcohol consumption issues compared to the non-disorder group. This indicates more serious alcohol-related problems within AUD group.\nFrom the right chart of Figure 12, as alcohol consumption frequency increases, the proportion of people with AUD increase. The results of the Chi-Square indicate a statistically significant association between AUD and alcohol consumption frequency (\\(X^2 = 558.63, p &lt; 0.001\\)). This result confirm that higher level of alcohol consumption is associated with a greater likelihood of AUD, even though individuals with the AUD are present across all levels of consumption and fewer in heavy consumption.\nThough 60% of individuals with AUD consume fewer than 8 drinks per week, the refined categorization of the dependent variable allows us to detect meaningful differences between healthy individuals and those with AUD. In summary, although AUD should not be simplistically equated with heavy drinking, individuals with AUD indeed have a higher likelihood of engaging in heavy drinking. Thus, the drinking behaviors of individuals with AUD deserve more attention and targeted interventions.",

    "text": "We explored the relationship between various health conditions and alcohol consumption patterns. One of the key findings is that Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) does not always imply heavy drinking. While AUD is commonly associated with heavy alcohol consumption, we found that over 60% of individuals with AUD consume relatively low or moderate amounts of alcohol. This challenges conventional assumptions and suggests that AUD should not be defined solely by the quantity of alcohol consumed.\nAnother critical finding is the strong link between mental health conditions and high alcohol consumption. People with mental health disorders such as depression, anxiety, and PTSD are more likely to consume alcohol in larger quantities. Alcohol may serve as a potential coping mechanism for mental health struggles, suggesting that addressing mental health issues could be key to reducing drinking behaviors. Additionally, the relationship between mental health and alcohol consumption may also indicate the effect of alcohol on mental health, further emphasizing the need for more comprehensive treatment and prevention approaches that address both mental health and alcohol use.\nFurthermore, individuals with Alcohol Use Disorder are more likely to engage in heavy drinking. Although over 60% of those with AUD consume relatively low or moderate amounts of alcohol, there is a clear trend that those with AUD tend to drink more compared to those without the disorder. This finding highlights the importance of targeted interventions for individuals with AUD, as they are at a higher risk for severe alcohol-related problems.\nDespite these valuable findings, our study has some limitations. First, all data is self-reported, which may introduce bias and may not accurately reflect actual behavior. This could potentially invalidate the relationship between variables. Secondly, our study only identifies correlations, which does not imply causality. Future research could use longitudinal data to examine how changes in mental health or AUD may influence alcohol consumption over time.",
